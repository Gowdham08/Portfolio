                    I am currently pursuing my degree in Electronics and Communication
                    Engineering (ECE) with a strong passion for software development, web
                    development, and coding. I enjoy working on projects that involve
                    building web applications, developing software solutions, and
                    exploring new programming technologies. In addition to software, I
                    have a moderate level of experience in embedded systems, working with
                    microcontrollers, sensors, and real-time applications. I like bridging
                    the gap between hardware and software, creating efficient and
                    innovative solutions. I am always eager to learn, experiment with new
                    technologies, and take on challenges that push my skills further.
                    Whether it's coding, web development, or embedded systems, I strive to
                    improve and grow in the ever-evolving tech world.
